Fitness function implementation and validation 

Implement the fitness evaluation function used in the paper (mean squared error over the training data).  This fitness function takes a sample "program," with a LISP-like tree representation, as input.  Called it on the program for the correct answer, and also on a sub-optimal example, such as "GD = M2*GNP82,"
